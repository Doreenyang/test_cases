These tests are meant to ensure the correct number of art pieces requiring a large box fit in each large sized box. Packing rules come in the following three forms for standard boxes, however it is unclear how these rules extrapolate to large boxes:
1. 6 Pieces per box: Mediums are Paper Print - Framed with Glass or Acrylic glazing
2. 4 Pieces per box: Mediums are Acoustic panels (framed or gallery) and Canvas (framed or gallery)
3. 8 Pieces per box: Mediums are Glass

It is your job to answer the question of how these rules extrapolate to large boxes.

Instructions:
Within each directory, create a unique input file for each medium fitting that packing rule by copying the provided template. Within each input file, replace X, Y, Z with the appropriate medium and quantity. 

Updated the expected output json file to match the expected output for all of the inputs you create (all inputs should create the same output).

X - quantity - given by the final number in the directory name
Y - Medium - ensure the medium is included in the input files name (Medium_input.csv for example)
Z - Glazing if required (Paper prints only), include this in the input file name as well (Paper_Print_Framed_Glass_input.csv for example)

Create a text file in each directory and give a quick justification for your output. One per directory is ok, rather than one per input.
