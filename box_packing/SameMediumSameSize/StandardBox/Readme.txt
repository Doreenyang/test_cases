These tests are meant to ensure the correct number of standard sized art pieces fit in each standard sized box. Packing rules come in the following three forms for standard boxes:
1. 6 Pieces per box: Mediums are Paper Print - Framed with Glass or Acrylic glazing
2. 4 Pieces per box: Mediums are Acoustic panels (framed or gallery) and Canvas (framed or gallery)
3. 8 Pieces per box: Mediums are Glass

Instructions:
Within each directory, create a unique input file for each medium fitting that packing rule by copying the provided template. Within each input file, replace X, Y, Z with the appropriate medium and quantity. 

Updated the expected output json file to match the expected output for all of the inputs you create (all inputs should create the same output).

X - quantity - given by the final number in the directory name
Y - Medium - include the medium in the name of the input files (Acoustic_Framed_input.csv for example)
Z - Glazing if required (Paper prints only) - include the glazing in the input file name if needed (Paper_Print_Framed_Glass_input.csv for example)

Create a text file and give a quick justification for your output. One per directory is ok, rather than one per input.
