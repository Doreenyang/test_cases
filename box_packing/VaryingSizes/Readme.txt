In these tests, we aim to identify what size box is required for varying dimensions. Each test case has one input piece of art (the medium does not matter) with varying dimensions. The output should be one of three options:
1. 1 stanard box
2. 1 large box
3. 1 piece requiring custom packaging

Please replace the 'X' 'X' in the input csv file with the approriate dimesions based on the directory name. Determine the correct output and replace "<value>" in the output json file with the appropriate value for each box type. 

Create a text file and justify your answer.
